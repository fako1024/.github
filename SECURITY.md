## Reporting a Vulnerability 

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. Thank you for improving
the security of our open source software. We appreciate your efforts and
responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.

Report security vulnerabilities by sending an email to:
    
    TBD@example.com

We will acknowledge your email as soon as possible, and will send a more
detailed response shortly thereafter indicating the next steps in handling
your report. After the initial reply to your report, we will endeavor to
keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and
may ask for additional information or guidance.

Please report security vulnerabilities in third-party modules to the person
or team maintaining the respective module.

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will assign it to a primary handler.
This person will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following
steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes
    will be released as fast as possible.
